  <div class="text">Today is all about you, the most amazing, beautiful, and incredible person in my life. Every day with you feels like a gift. Today, I celebrate the gift that you are. I want you to know how much you mean to me. You light up my days with your smile. You make my heart skip a beat with your laugh. Your love makes me feel like the luckiest person in the world.

I hope this year brings you as much happiness, joy, and love as you’ve given me. May all your dreams come true, and may we continue making countless memories together, hand in hand, heart to heart.

Thank you for being you, for your kindness, warmth, humor, and for loving me just as I am. I can’t wait to celebrate you today and always.

Happy Birthday, my love. Here’s to more laughter, adventures, and endless love. - Robert</div>
